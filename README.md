# BIOC0023: Oral Microbiome Rroject
This repository contains the codes used for the analysis of the oral microbiome in the effect of teeth whitening as part of the module BIOC0023: Specialist Research Project in Metagenomics. The aim of this project was to investigate the effect Carbon Coco's activated charcoal-based teeth whitening polish on the oral microbiome, and specifically of the teeth microbiome.

The microbiome analysis of the sequencing data obtained was conducted through the bioinformatics pipeline QIIME. This was done by submitting jobs using the high performance computing system Cirrus. All the scripts are in the Portable Batch System (PBS) format which defines the commands and resources used to run the jobs.
